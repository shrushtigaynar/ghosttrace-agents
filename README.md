# 👻 GhostTrace

> **AI-Powered Software Investigation Room**

GhostTrace is an AI-powered software investigation platform that helps developers understand **why a codebase became difficult to maintain**, not just what is wrong with it.

Unlike traditional static analyzers that generate warnings and metrics, GhostTrace reconstructs the story of a software system by analyzing its architecture, dependencies, code structure, and engineering patterns through a team of specialized AI investigators.

The result is a forensic-style investigation report that identifies architectural decay, technical debt, risky engineering decisions, future failure points, and actionable recovery strategies.

# 🚨 Problem

Modern software systems slowly become harder to maintain because of:

- Technical debt accumulation
- Architectural drift
- Dependency sprawl
- Inconsistent engineering decisions
- Lack of historical context

Existing tools answer:

> What is wrong?

GhostTrace answers:

> How did we get here, and what happens next?

# ✨ Core Idea

Think of GhostTrace as a software crime investigation room.

Instead of generating another lint report, GhostTrace:

1. Collects evidence
2. Reconstructs history
3. Predicts future risks
4. Challenges assumptions
5. Generates recovery plans

# 🏆 Hackathon Vision

GhostTrace transforms software maintenance from debugging code into investigating software history.

Instead of simply reporting defects, it reconstructs the engineering story behind a system, predicts future risks, and provides a roadmap for recovery.
teams understand why a codebase became difficult to maintain and what should be done next.
